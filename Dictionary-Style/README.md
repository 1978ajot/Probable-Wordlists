# What am I looking at?

### BEncyclopedia-Parts
  * The BEncyclopedia Wordlist contains all of the other wordlists contained in the Dictionary-Style Folder (and some not)
  * The full BEncyclopedia Wordlist couldn't fit in one file, so I broke it up into parts
  
### Includes Non-English Dictionary Parts
  * A Dictionary Wordlist containing languages with Latin (or Latin Variant) alphabets
 
### Misc Wordlists
  * A pet project of mine I revisit now and again.
  * Includes topical wordlists such as types of dogs, beverages, geographical location, Mythical figures, esoterica, and more
  * I just find these fun - I've used them for Codenames, Drinking Games and randomization schemes.

### BENcyclopedia-Link
  * A link to a Megaupload file (1.01GB) containing the entire BEncyclopedia
  
### Includes Non-English Dictionary Link
  *A link to a Megaupload file (67 MB) containing the entire "Includes Non-English" Dictionary
