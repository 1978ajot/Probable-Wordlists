# Probable Wordlists
Wordlists sorted by populatirty originally created for password generation and testing

### Why slog through an encylopedic, alphabetized wordlist when you can start with the words people are most likely to use?

There are some great wordlists out there, but I decided to amalgamate, edit, trim and create a few of my own.


## Real-Passwords
The files in this folder come from https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists, https://weakpass.com/ and https://hashes.org/

I've taken nearly all of the real passwords from these sites, combined them into a single list, removed duplicates and sorted by popularity. I couldn't find many lists that weren't sorted alphabetically - it seems like a dictionary attack should reflect actual human behavior as opposed to the alphabet. 

NOTE THAT FOR THIS FIRST VERSION, ALL NON-ASCII CHARACTERS HAVE BEEN REMOVED.
A more inclusive, and thus, more accurate list is in the works.

Lists sorted by popularity will include "probable" in the filename


## Dictionary-Style Lists

Wordlists including dictionaries, encyclopedic lists and miscellaneous.
